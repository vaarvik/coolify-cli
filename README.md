## Configuration File

The CLI uses a YAML configuration file located at `~/.coolify-cli/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Coolify CLI Configuration
# Get your API key from your Coolify instance
api_key: "your-api-key-here"

# Your Coolify instance URL (without /api/v1)
host_url: "https://app.coolify.io"

# API path (usually /api/v1)
api_path: "/api/v1"
```

## API Key Security

- The configuration file is created with restricted permissions (0600)
- API keys are masked when displayed in `config show`
- Never commit your configuration file to version control

## Development

This CLI is built with:
- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for CLI structure
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration management
- Go's standard `net/http` package for API calls
